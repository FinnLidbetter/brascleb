License

The YAWL list, word.list, is in the Public Domain. There are no restrictions on
its use or distribution.

The author decided to release the list into the Public Domain because it is based
primarily on other Public Domain lists by the author and his colleague, Alan
Beale, and applying the stricter GPL to it would therefore be of doubtful validity.

The author has also released the source code to "anagram" and "multi" (multiple
word anagram) into the Public Domain. He had previously posted these utilities on
the "alt.sources" newsgroup in shar archive form.

The author has released his "wstrings.sh" script into the Public Domain. It is
part of his "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide" which is hosted on the Linux
Documentation Project.

Please feel free to use the word list and/or source code in your own projects. It
is, in fact, the intent of the author that this package inspire word game software
for the Linux platform. If you use any portion of YAWL, please, as a courtesy, give
credit to its author.

Note that "Public Domain" means Public Domain. Even if portions or the whole of
this package are incorporated into a commercial or proprietary application, those
portions of YAWL within it remain Public Domain.
