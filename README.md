# Slobsterble
Slobsterble is a turn-based word game for 2--4 players played on a 15 by 15 grid. 
It is based on the game Scrabble<sup>TM</sup>. 

This project is being developed in response to discontinued support for the Scrabble
app offered by Electronic Arts (EA). The EA Scrabble<sup>TM</sup> app has been
replaced by the Scrabble Go app developed by Scopely.

The skeleton for this app is based on the Flask tutorial found here:
