# Brascleb
Brascleb is a turn-based word game for 2--4 players played on a 15 by 15 grid. 
It is based on another game, which we will refer to as "Game X" for trademark 
infringement reasons, and is being developed in response to discontinued 
support for the Electronic Arts Game X app in favour of a Game X app developed 
by Scopely.
